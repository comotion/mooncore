========

Mooncore aims to be a complete replacement for coreutils with only ljsyscall as a dependency.
The aim is to provide GNU-compatible coreutils in pure lua.

With LuaJIT and ljsyscall Lua becomes a complete systems programming language with the
flexibility of scripts and speed of native execution. This may lead to an efficient,
portable and architecture-independent userland free from GNU bloat and the execution overhead
of shell scripts.

This is an experimental idea in its infancy, and we provide only implementations of  
the binaries that we found needful.

If you find the project interesting, go ahead and implement a binary and send us
a pull request.
